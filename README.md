# Small-Business-Recovery
Small Business Recovery can be used to promote small businesses operating during a disease pandemic and understand the impact of the pandemic on small businesses in their communities, as well as analyze and understand areas that have been reopened for business so that it can be a guide for restoring business activities in the community.
