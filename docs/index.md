## Welcome to SMALL BUSINESS RECOVERY 

SMALL BUSINESS RECOVERY can be used to promote small businesses operating during a disease pandemic and understand the impact of the pandemic on small businesses in their communities, as well as analyze and understand areas that have been reopened for business so that it can be a guide for restoring business activities in the community.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/KOSASIH/Small-Business-Recovery/edit/main/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
